# face_mask_detection

Face mask detection is an object detection task that detects whether people are wearing masks or not in videos.

So in this assignment i have done the real time face detections by using YOLO and deepsort along with the Opencv there are the steps which is followed in the process to to achieve the image recognition

Importing required Libraries
Connection to the Google drive
After that we are cloning with the Git Repo.
And change the directory
Install all the requirements.txt
Then download the pre-trained weights
Training the model of yolo using the face mask dataset(dataset.yaml(in which i have mentioned clear address of the train and val images) The dataset.yaml file is stored on my drive .....and i have used the yolo weights for the training purpose....I have upload the yolov5s.pt weights.
Detection on new images
used opencv for displaying the detected images (which i detect in above cell) and this is my self
Detection on video
Just download the final video
export your model's weights for future use
